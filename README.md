# Freight Forwarding

Freight Forwarding System is a new intranet-based logistics CMS

The applciation can handle the following:
* System User and groups
* Transactions and calculate profit per currency
* Container with different types
* Sales and their revenue / profitability
* Notification system / Work flow for the orders
* Handle many types of shipment (air / sea / land)
And much more !

To start with just restore the DB on SQL Server 2012 or higher and host the app using IIS 7+
and start working !

Note the system admin user is found and changing in SystemConfig table in DB
I will keep this updated as much as I can.
